        "In this part of our notebook, we’re installing and updating all the tools we need for our project. First, we install transformers so we can use BERT and other language models, datasets to help us load and handle our tweet data, and accelerate so training can run faster, especially on GPU. We also install scikit-learn because we use it for machine learning utilities like splitting data and evaluating models, emoji to help clean and handle emojis in the text, pandas for working with tables and CSV files, and matplotlib plus seaborn so we can make graphs and visualizations. We also install optuna because we use it to tune our model’s hyperparameters. After that, we run another command to upgrade transformers, accelerate, and datasets to the latest versions, just to make sure everything is up to date and compatible before we train and fine-tune our BERT model."

We bring in libraries like NumPy and Pandas to help us work with the dataset, Matplotlib and Seaborn to help us visualize it, and scikit-learn to help us evaluate our model later on. We also import PyTorch and the HuggingFace Transformers library because we are using a BERT-based model for classification. To make our results consistent every time we run the notebook, we set a random seed for NumPy, PyTorch, and Python. After that, we check whether a GPU is available because using a GPU will make training much faster. Finally, we load our dataset from the CSV file and print out its first few rows, along with the dataset’s shape and column names, so we can get a quick look at what our data contains before processing it."

        "In this section, we check the basic structure and quality of our dataset. We start by printing the number of samples for each label, both in numeric form and in text form, so we can see whether our classes are balanced or uneven. Next, we look for any missing values to make sure our dataset is clean and doesn’t have empty entries that could cause errors later. After that, we calculate the length of each tweet to understand how long the messages usually are, and we print summary statistics like the average and maximum length. Finally, we create a histogram to visualize the distribution of tweet lengths. This helps us see whether most tweets are short, long, or somewhere in between, which is important when deciding how we will tokenize and feed the text into our BERT model."

        "We focus on cleaning the text so it becomes easier for our model to understand. We start by setting patterns that help us detect URLs, mentions, and hashtags. Inside our clean_text function, we remove URLs completely since they don’t add meaningful information. For mentions, we replace them with a blank space because the usernames themselves don’t matter. For hashtags, we keep the actual word but remove the “#” because the hashtag word can still give useful context. We also remove emojis by turning them into spaces, since emojis might express emotion but can’t be understood directly by BERT. To keep the text readable, we only remove unusual symbols while keeping punctuation like commas and question marks. Then we lowercase everything to keep the text consistent and remove extra spaces. Finally, we apply this cleaning function to every tweet and print the original text next to the cleaned version so we can easily compare them and see how the cleaning improves the input for our model."

We load its tokenizer and convert our train, validation, and test splits into HuggingFace Dataset objects while keeping only the essential columns. Then, we tokenize all tweets by padding or truncating them to a maximum length of 256 characters so the model receives consistent-sized input. After tokenization, we format everything for PyTorch by keeping only the input IDs, attention masks, and labels. We also make sure the labels are stored as torch.long, since that is the format required by the loss function used during training. Finally, we print the processed training dataset so we can verify that everything is correctly prepared before we move on to model fine-tuning."

Instead of guessing learning rates or batch sizes ourselves, we let Optuna try different combinations and check which settings give us the highest macro F1 score on the validation set. We create a function that calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and macro F1, and another function that Optuna uses to run each trial. Inside the trial, we ask Optuna to suggest values for things like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, weight decay, and warmup ratio. For every trial, we train a small version of the model, evaluate it, and keep track of the best-performing setup. We also enable pruning so that bad trials stop early and don’t waste time. After running all the trials, Optuna shows us which hyperparameters worked the best and gives us a summary of the top trials so we know how to fine-tune the final model more effectively."

        "We then take the best hyperparameters found by Optuna and prepare them for the final full training run. If Optuna didn’t produce any results, we fall back to a default set of values so the model can still be trained properly. We also make sure the warmup ratio is included and increase the number of training epochs if the search used fewer. After that, we combine the training and validation sets so the model can learn from as much data as possible. We tokenize this combined dataset again to match the format that our model needs. Next, we load a fresh XLM-RoBERTa model, update its configuration to make sure it understands that we are working on a single-label classification task, and set up all the training arguments such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, weight decay, and logging settings. We also enable early stopping so training ends automatically if we stop improving. Finally, we train the model using all the tuned settings, save the finished model and tokenizer, and confirm that the final version has been stored."

        "In this last part of our notebook, we prepare everything we need to test our final model on new text. We start by creating dictionaries that map each label ID to its text label and vice versa, so our predictions are easy to read. Then we define a predict_sentiment function that takes any input tweet, cleans it using the same cleaning steps we used during training, and sends it through our fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model. We tokenize the text, move it to the correct device (CPU or GPU), and get the model’s output. After that, we apply softmax to convert the logits into probabilities, find the label with the highest score, and also return how confident the model is in that prediction. Finally, we test the function using a few sample Taglish sentences—one alarming, one informative, and one reassuring—so we can see how well our trained model interprets real messages. Each output shows the original text, the cleaned text, the predicted label, and the confidence score."

        "Last, we build an interactive tool that lets us type in any tweet and instantly see how our model classifies it. We start by printing a header so the user knows they are in prediction mode, and we explain that typing “quit” or “exit” will stop the program. Inside a loop, we keep asking the user to enter a tweet. Each time, we clean the text, send it to our trained model, and then print the original tweet, the cleaned version, the predicted label, and the model’s confidence level. If the user types something invalid, we ask them to try again, and if an error happens, we catch it and display a message. This interactive feature makes it easy for us to test how well our model understands real tweets in different situations."
